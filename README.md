# NNB Map Board 

Restful API using Flask <br>
Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pip 9.0
- PostgreSQL 

## Setup 
If your developing with Windows, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ <br>
To install Postgres with Homebrew([postgresapp](http://postgresapp.com/) also works):
```
$ brew install postgresql
$ brew link postgresql
```
This should start your postgres server(Ctrl-C to stop):
```
$ postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
```
It should say ```listening on IPv6 address "::1", port 5432``` If not, change the port. On a separate CLI:
```
$ createdb
$ psql -h localhost
```
Always remember to use the same virtual environement!!!! This is a good practice for any python development. <br>
First, install virtualenv, create and activate the environment called **venv**, and install the python package dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To deactivate when you're using it:
```
$ deactivate venv
```
After installing Postgres, in your CLI create a user and database and grant privileges:
```
$ psql
# create user nbb with password 'password';
# create database nbb_db owner nbb encoding 'utf-8';
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nbb_db TO nbb;
```


## Run Development Server
To run the server, make sure you are in the root directory:
```
python run.py
```

The API should be at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ for you to experience its beauty LOL 

## Git Flow 
Before you start making changes, make sure you have the most recently updated version of `master`:
```
git pull
```

Make a new branch for your changes:
```
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

If you want to see all of your branches that exist:
```
git branch
```

If you want to switch to a branch that already exists:
```
git checkout <branch_name>
```

Make sure you commit your changes to your own branch! 

Push your code and submit a PR to leave it up for review:
```
git push
```
This might walk you through some remote branch push settings, just follow what it says. It should only happen the first time you push to a new branch

Then go to this repo on Github, refresh the page, and you should see an option to create a pull request from your branch.

## Code Reviews
It is recommended to:
1) Keep PRs small and manageable
2) Put up a PR early on (even before it is ready for review), so you can get early feedback

### Labels:
#### `In Progress` 
Use this while you are working on your changes. Reviewers can take a look to make sure you're on the right track and make some suggestions along the way. Also use this as a way to ask questions about your code (_Is this the right way to do x?, Does this follow conventions properly?, etc._).

#### `Ready For Review`
Use this when you feel like your code is ready to be thoroughly reviewed before shipping. Assign your PR to your technical lead and teammates who know more about the areas you worked on (Github might have suggestions based on previous contributions).

#### `In Review`
Reviewers, set this to indicate the PR is currently being reviewed.

#### `SHIP IT`
Reviewers, set this to indicate the PR is ready to be merged, but let the pull requester do the merging.

PRs can't be merged without at least one reviewer approving your changes. If waiting on your reviewer becomes a blocker, bug them about it!

## Conventions
- **Controllers**, which describe API endpoints will be defined under ``api/views/*``. We will be using [Flask Blueprints](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/blueprints/) for easier collaborations in view controllers. Be sure to know how to use them. <br>
- The **Database** Structure will be defined under ``api/models.py``

## MISC

If you're annoyed by the __pycache__ files 
```
find . | grep -E "(__pycache__|\.pyc|\.pyo$)" | xargs rm -rf
```

Feel free to contact me for questions :)
